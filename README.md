# Shutter Card for Home Assistant

A custom Lovelace card for controlling European-style roller shutters (Jalousien/Rollläden) in Home Assistant.

## What makes this card different?

Most shutter cards treat covers as simple open/close devices. European roller shutters behave differently: the panel consists of individual slats that are pulled apart by gravity as the shutter lowers, forming visible gaps between them. These gaps only close once the bottom edge of the panel reaches the bottom and the slats compress under their own weight. It's common to want the shutter lowered but with gaps still open for ventilation and light.

This card natively understands that behavior and lets you define **configurable position presets** — specific percentage values that can be targeted directly, making it easy to reach common positions like "closed with slats open" or "half-open" with a single tap.

## Features

- Native support for European roller shutter behavior (slat positions)
- Configurable position presets with icons and optional labels
- Snap-point slider with preset icons as anchor points
- Control of `cover` entities
- HACS installation support

### Options

| Option    | Type   | Required | Description                                 |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `entity`     | string | yes      | A `cover` entity ID                         |
| `name`       | string | no       | Override the entity's display name          |
| `icon`       | string | no       | Override the entity's icon                  |
| `presets`    | list   | no       | List of position presets                    |
| `tap_action` | object | no       | Action when tapping the header (default: `more-info`) |

### Preset options

| Option     | Type   | Required | Description                                       |
|------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `icon`     | string | yes      | Icon to display (e.g. `mdi:blinds-horizontal`)    |
| `label`    | string | no       | Optional display name (shown in chip buttons)     |
| `position` | number | yes      | Target position (0–100)                           |

Preset icons are displayed as snap points on the slider. If a `label` is defined, the preset also appears as a chip button below the slider (full variant only). Open (100%) and Closed (0%) are always present as fixed snap points and don't need to be configured.

### Tap action

Tapping the header area (icon + name) triggers a configurable action. Default is `more-info`.

| Option            | Type   | Description                                          |
|-------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `action`          | string | `more-info`, `navigate`, `call-service`, `toggle`, `none` |
| `navigation_path` | string | Path for `navigate` (e.g. `/lovelace/room`)          |
| `service`         | string | Service for `call-service` (e.g. `cover.open_cover`) |
| `data`            | object | Additional service data for `call-service`           |

```yaml
tap_action:
  action: navigate
  navigation_path: /lovelace/living-room
```
